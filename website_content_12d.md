## 6. ABOUT US

### Our Mission: Democratizing World-Class Career Intelligence

**The Story Behind Remiro AI**

Founded in 2024 by a team of career counselors, AI researchers, and industry veterans who were frustrated by the superficial nature of existing career tools. We believed everyone deserves access to the kind of deep, personalized career guidance that was previously available only to executives through expensive consulting firms.

**Our Breakthrough: The 12D Framework**

After analyzing thousands of successful career transitions, we identified 12 critical dimensions that determine career success. Traditional tools focus on just 2-3 dimensions (usually skills and interests). Our AI system analyzes all 12 dimensions simultaneously, creating unprecedented accuracy in career guidance.

**The Team**

**Vishwa Rajesh** - *CEO & Co-founder*
Former career counselor and EdTech executive with 12+ years of experience helping professionals navigate career transitions.

- Rajesh Sawhney - Serial entrepreneur and startup mentor
- Dr. Amit Prakash - Career psychology researcher, IIT Delhi

### Our Values

**🎯 Precision Over Generalization**
We believe career guidance should be hyper-personalized, not one-size-fits-all.
