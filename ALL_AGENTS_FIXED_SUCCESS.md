### 3. **User Profiles Fixed**
- 📁 **Total profiles processed**: 34
- 🔧 **Profiles fixed**: 31  
- ✅ **Result**: All profiles now have 12 assessment slots initialized

### 4. **What Was the Root Cause?**
The issue was **missing assessment structure in user profiles**. When users had incomplete profile data:
- Some profiles were missing assessment dimensions entirely
- The dashboard only showed available (non-completed) assessments
- If 8 assessments were already marked complete, only 4 remaining would show
- Missing assessments weren't initialized properly

### 5. **The Fix Applied**
```json
// Each user profile now has this complete structure:
{
    "name": "User Name",
    "background": "Professional", 
    "assessments": {
        "personality": {"completed": false, "data": null, "completed_at": null},
        "interests": {"completed": false, "data": null, "completed_at": null},
        "aspirations": {"completed": false, "data": null, "completed_at": null},
        "skills": {"completed": false, "data": null, "completed_at": null},
        "motivations_values": {"completed": false, "data": null, "completed_at": null},
        "cognitive_abilities": {"completed": false, "data": null, "completed_at": null},
        "learning_preferences": {"completed": false, "data": null, "completed_at": null},
        "physical_context": {"completed": false, "data": null, "completed_at": null},
        "strengths_weaknesses": {"completed": false, "data": null, "completed_at": null},
        "emotional_intelligence": {"completed": false, "data": null, "completed_at": null},
        "track_record": {"completed": false, "data": null, "completed_at": null},
        "constraints": {"completed": false, "data": null, "completed_at": null}
    }
